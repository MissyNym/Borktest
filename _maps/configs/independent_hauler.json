	"description": "The Hauler-class consists of a cabin that holds only gear essential to survival, as well as a large cargo hold made for hauling supplies and otherwise around. Little considerations are made for comfort;just about every part on the ship is crammed into wherever it would fit while still functioning. While the small footprint may leave a lot to be desired, the ship itself is extremely cheap even by spacefaring standards, and is usually staffed by two pilots at most working around the clock to keep the ship afloat.",
